            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>MaybeVoid is the personal site for <a href="/pages/soareschen.html">Soares Chen</a>. I blog about functional programming in languages including Haskell, Racket, OCaml, Rust. I also write about research topics in programming languages including Type Theory, Algebraic Effects, Linear Types, and Formal Verification.</p>
<p>In general, if you understands how the Haskell type <code>Maybe Void</code> is equivalent to <code>()</code>, or if you are interested in finding that out, then you might be interested to read my posts here.</p>
<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>
<p>This site is mainly targeted towards Haskell enthusiasts with interest to learn about Haskell and beyond. I would assume that you have at least some knowledge in Haskell, and that you are into functional programming. I write about various topics in programming languages, but it would be from the perspective of intermediate Haskell programmers who are new to those topics.</p>
