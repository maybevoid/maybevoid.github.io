      <h1>Soares Chen</h1>
      <h2 id="about-myself">About Myself</h2>
<p>My official name is Ruofei Chen (陈若飞), with Soares being my nickname. I am a Malaysian Chinese grew up in Penang. I spent a little over ten years studying and living in Singapore. I recently moved to Leipzig, Germany, and would stay here for at least a while.</p>
<p>I am a programming language enthusiast for many years, spending most of my early days hacking the web. In recent years, I got interested in functional programming and started learning Haskell. That lead me into the rabbit hole of discovering the world of programming language research.</p>
<p>I have many years of mainstream programming experience, although I am relatively new in the fields of functional programming and programming language research. There are many things that excites me and I am still learning a lot every day. I started MaybeVoid to share the things I learned, and also to connect to the broader programming language community around the world.</p>
<p>To pay my bills while still learning things, I spent my day time doing functional programming in JavaScript. This will hopefully change soon when I start my first Haskell job in a few months time.</p>
